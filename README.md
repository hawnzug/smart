## Yet another Chinese word segmentation in Python

The dict and HMM model is from [结巴中文分词](https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba)

Expand the dict from [Here](http://download.csdn.net/detail/logken/3575376). Now the dict has 665303 words.

It's unfinished, I only write the viterbi algorithm based on HMM.
